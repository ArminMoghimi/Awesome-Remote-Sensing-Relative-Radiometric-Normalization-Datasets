# Awesome-Remote-Sensing-Relative-Radiometric-Normalization-Datasets
These datasets were used for Change Detection (CD) and Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) of multi-temporal satellite images . Datasets details can be found at [A Novel Radiometric Control Set Sample Selection Strategy for Relative Radiometric Normalization of Multi-temporal Satellite Images] which was accepted in IEEE TGRS; cite if you use These datasets.
